                <h3>General Information</h3>
                <p>Datasaur Royale is a battle simulator, on top of Pygame, between different kinds of dinosaurs each with different traits, attempting to find the best traits that allow dinosaurs to survive. Traits may affect their speed, how much energy they can store and consume, their combat capabilities, and other behaviors such as passive or more aggressive behaviors. There are terrain elements such as grass and ground which affect some dinosaur behaviors. Each generation spawns 25 dinosaurs and they fight until 4 are left remaining. These are assumed to be the dinosaurs with the best traits. The next generations will contain the children of the 4 winning dinosaurs from the previous generation. However, each offspring has a random chance to mutate and take on a completely different trait. As generations pass, users can observe which dinosaurs tend to survive through several generations and which die off quickly.</p>
                
                <p>Below are the game stats, determining things like a dinosaur's location, color, and size. In addition, there are dino stats for every dinosaur as well as different dinosaur behaviors such as goToGreensOnly, which are dinosaurs who prioritize food over fighting other dinosaurs.</p>
