                        <h3>General Struggles and Solutions</h3>
                        <p>This was my first time creating my own coding project. I&apos;d just finished taking an Object-Oriented Programming class and had learn about the basic data structures such as arrays and linked lists. For my first project, I wanted to create a simple game. I had always loved adventure games and visual novels, where players could read a bunch of dialogue and make choices to conclude to a certain ending based on those decisions. A choices-matter type of game. I had a general story plot in mind but I wanted players to be able to interact with locations and use items to unlock certain areas. Therefore, I needed to plan out a way to keep track of the player&apos;s items as they play. I originally thought about using an array to store the items but it wasn&apos;t very efficient when it came to removing and finding a specific item. A similar case for linked lists, in order to figure out whether a player had a specific item, we&apos;d have to iterate through the entire linked list. Since there were operations that run in O(n) time when using arrays and linked list, I needed to find something faster. This is when I started doing some research on ways to make adding items, removing items, and checking an item&apos;s existence more efficient. This is when I came across and decided to use a hashmap, which checks all of the boxes. By using a hashmap, I&apos;m able to check an item&apos;s existence by checking its corresponding key value. In addition, adding and removing these items are fairly easy as well, all running in O(1) time.</p>
