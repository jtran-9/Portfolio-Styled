                    <p>
                        Hi my name is Justin Tran. I am from San Francisco and I am a Computer Science Major at University of California, San Diego. 
                        <br>I enjoy doing things such as snowboarding, swimming, drawing, playing games (i.e. Stardew Valley, Honkai Star Rail, and CyberPunk). I also really like listening to K-Pop and watching anime.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you like JOJO's Bizarre Adventure or K-Pop let me know, we'll have a lot to talk about! :&#41;
                    </p>

                    <h3>Technical Background</h3>
                    <p>
                        I've always been amazed by the amount of work that indie developers had put into their work to make users have enjoyable and memorable experiences. Because of this I decided to try coding my first project in high school, a quiz that allows users familiar with a certain tv show to answer questions and test their knowledge. I then expanded by making a text-based game and a dynamic battle simulation. In addition to games, I was also interested in creating websites that could help users in everyday life.
                        I've been using my free time to learn a lot more about web development. In that time, I've been able to create useful applications that assist users organize their thoughts and even spread awareness to current issues like climate change. I enjoy combining both of my interests by trying to implement appealing or fun elements to my websites such as an activity or simply by adding a more aesthetic and more interactive look to the website.
